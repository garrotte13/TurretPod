# Turret Pod
This mod gives vehicles an advantage they miss to make them an interesting alternative to combat shotgun + rocket launcher exoskeleton-muscled typical assaults. Can be even more useful together with tank's ability to quickly move over [creep](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Warmonger).

Entities architecture idea was taken from nice Gun Equipment mod by Zdenek (DeznekCZ) and Qon. Best regards for great idea missing in other mods.
Everything else was change. UPS-hungry reload issue was fixed and turned into mod key advantage - consume electrical power to reload expendable ammo.

- balanced mix of ammo and electricity consumption,
- several tiers of pods, top tiers are available for Rampant Arsenal mod users only (one does need them only to counter Rampant New Enemies top tiers) and require nuclear-powered vehicles.
- unload ammo shortcut,
- predictable ammo selection. One can load particular ammo into every turret pod no matter its type.

Vehicle Wagon 2 mod is supported, but requires a patched (maybe one day a new released) version of that mod.

If using hundreds turret pods in many vehicles reload will be slowed down a little, but without big UPS impact.

Should be compatible with other mods (bob's warfare, krastorio2) and multiplayer - help wanted for tests !

Recommended mods combo: Rampant, Rampant Arsenal, Warmonger. Idea is to replace overpowered Rampant Arsenal mod's Personal Cannon, Shotgun and Bullet defense equipments, keeping only electrical and slowing down, while adding not only physical damage defenses.
Best recommendation is Building Time mod (with free repairing cheatfix patch of course).
