# Turret Pod
This mod gives vehicles an advantage they miss to make them an interesting alternative to combat shotgun / rocket launcher exoskeleton-muscled assaults. Can be even more useful together with tank's ability to quickly move over [creep](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Warmonger).

Idea and entities architecture were taken from nice Gun Equipment mod by Zdenek (DeznekCZ) and Qon.
With a number of improvements:

- balanced mix of ammo and electricity consumption,
- several tiers of pods,
- unload ammo shortcut,
- predictable ammo selection.

Scripts were completely replaced. More turret pods doesn't mean more UPS consumption, but if using hundreds in many vehicles (why so many vehicles?) reload will intentionally be slowed down.

Should be compatible with other mods (bob's warfare, k2) and multiplayer - no time for test. Help wanted.
