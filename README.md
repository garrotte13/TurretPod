This mod gives vehicles an advantage they miss to make them an interesting alternative to combat shotgun / rocket launcher exoskeleton-muscled assaults. Can be even more useful together with tank's ability to quickly move over creep.

Idea and entities architecture were taken from nice Gun Equipment mod by Zdenek (DeznekCZ) and Qon.
I was shocked by the enormous advantage in core of the mod comparing to Rampant Arsenal and Schall GunPod overpowered features, so I had to take it and turn its weak spot (high UPS impact) into its advantage:
balanced mix of ammo and electricity consumption. It made this mod give benefits only in midgame and later, not in early game unless some kind of Schall Primary dry Battery is played with. But one should be fine with grenades and submachine gun at that stage.

Scripts were completely replaced. More turret pods doesn't mean more UPS consumption, but if using hundreds in many vehicles (bad idea of some mods) reload will intentionally be slowed down.

Should be compatible with other mods (bob's warfare, k2) and multiplayer - no time for test. Help wanted.
