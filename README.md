# Turret Pod

This mod gives vehicles an advantage they miss to make them an interesting alternative to combat shotgun + rocket launcher exoskeleton-muscled typical assaults. Can be even more useful together with tank's ability to quickly move over [creep](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Warmonger).

Entities architecture was taken from nice Gun Equipment mod by Zdenek (DeznekCZ) and Qon. Best regards for great idea missing in other mods.
Everything else was implemented from scratch. UPS-hungry reload issue was fixed and turned into mod balance feature - consume electrical power to reload expendable ammo.

- Balanced mix of ammo and electricity consumption,
- Minigun turret pod - 3 tiers,
- Shotgun turret pod - 3 tiers,
- Flamethrower turret pod (tank attack type) - 2 tiers.
- Third tier is available for Rampant Arsenal mod users only (one does need them only to counter Rampant New Enemies top tiers) and require nuclear-powered vehicles.
- Unload ammo action available via tool shortcut (Alt+U by default),
- Predictable ammo selection. With mod setting to lock ammo consuming reload for each pod.
- Vehicle Wagon 2 mod is supported.
- Should be compatible with other mods (bob's warfare, krastorio2) and multiplayer.

If no equipment grid was added by other mods default car receives a small grid.

If using hundreds turret pods in many vehicles reload will be distributed in more ticks, but without considerable UPS impact.

## How it works

1. Add power source in vehicle equipment (early game - solar panels + personal battery; mid game - portable reactor and battery)
1. Store corresponding ammo (magazines, shells, flamethrower ammo)
1. Insert Minigun/Shotgun/Flame turret pod in the grid

Recommended mods combo: Rampant (with New Enemies tier7+), Rampant Arsenal, Warmonger.
Idea is to replace overpowered Rampant Arsenal mod's Personal Cannon, Shotgun and Bullet defense equipments, keeping only electrical and slowing down ones, while adding not only physical damage defenses, but all ammo types.

Another hardcore recommendation is Building Time mod.
